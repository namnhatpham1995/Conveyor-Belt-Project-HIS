# Project HIS: Verifying Papyrus-RT Models with nuXmv (Project Summer Term 2020)
## Airport Conveyor Belt (Team 6)
### Team 6's members: 
* Vo Duy Hieu
* Pham Nhat Nam
* Cao Minh Gia Huy
* Dang Tong Ngoc
#### Description: 
* Papyrus-RT is an open-source modelling tool based on the concept of Model-Driven Engineering and is capable of generating executable C++ codes. It is intended for designing and developing complex, real-time, embedded systems. The modeling component of Papyrus-RT offers UML-RT for specifying software systems. 
* nuXmv on the other hand is a model checker, that can verify system models against a set of 
properties defined using temporal logics. 
  
As a part of the project work, each team comprising of 2-4 students, would need to perform 
the following set of activities - 
1. model a given example in the Papyrus-RT tool. 
2. compile and run their model and verify the model semantics using test cases. 
3. use a given set of rules to mechanically translate their model into an equivalent 
nuXmv model. 
4. verify this model against a set of system properties relevant for their example 
  
Systems like the Airport Conveyer Belt, Car Door Lock, Car Air Bag, Human Pacemaker, Parcel 
routing, Traffic Light or River Basin Management, could be chosen as an example for the 
project.  

Each team must submit a report, a presentation and their code for the final evaluation.
