# Project HIS: Verifying Papyrus-RT Models with nuXmv (Project Summer Term 2020)
## Airport Conveyor Belt (Team 6)
##### Team 6's members: 
* Vo Duy Hieu
* Pham Nhat Nam
* Cao Minh Gia Huy
* Dang Tong Ngoc
#### Description: 
This is the model of a simple conveyor belt system with one main line and two induction lines. The nuXmv model of the entire system is in the CBelt.smv file. Formal properties of the model are defined and verified using nuXmv model checker. File zip contains the Papyrus-RT model.

Throughout the project, two programs are used:
* Papyrus-RT is an open-source modelling tool based on the concept of Model-Driven Engineering and is capable of generating executable C++ codes. It is intended for designing and developing complex, real-time, embedded systems. The modeling component of Papyrus-RT offers UML-RT for specifying software systems. 
* nuXmv on the other hand is a model checker, that can verify system models against a set of 
properties defined using temporal logics. 
  
The tasks to fulfill the requirements of the project: 
1. Model a given example in the Papyrus-RT tool. 
2. Compile and run their model and verify the model semantics using test cases. 
3. Use a given set of rules to mechanically translate their model into an equivalent 
nuXmv model. 
4. Verify this model against a set of system properties relevant for their example 
Each team must submit a report, a presentation and their code for the final evaluation.
